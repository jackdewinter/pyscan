## TL;DR ðŸ¥±

Project Summarizer is a tool used to summarize various files produced by other tools during a build or test process.
This tool is intended to be executed after running a test script or a build script.
The benefit to using the Project Summarizer tool is a quick summary of more terse information provided by other tools.
The goal is to provide the minimum level of feedback on changes to the project, avoiding a more costly lookup of the summarized information.
If that goal is met, then a simple look at that summarized information can replace a more costly lookup, such as having to switch focus to a locally hosted web page to figure out the impact of a change.

Our hope is that we can help developers achieve that goal at least 50 percent of the time.

## Supported Summarizers

The currently supported summarizers are:

- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) for test results
  - supported by JUnit and [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/)
- [Cobertura](https://github.com/cobertura/cobertura) for code coverage
  - supported by [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)

There are plans for an extension mechanism to support other summarizers soon.
